    <h3>Meaning  :</h3>
    <p>
    	<div>The value of money, then, is the quantity of goods in general that will be exchanged for one unit of money. The value of money is its purchasing power,</div>
    	<div>i.e., the quantity of goods and services it can purchase. What money can buy depends on the level of prices.</div>
    	<ul>
    		<li> When the price level rises, a unit of money can purchase less goods than before. Money is then said to have depreciated.</li>
    		<li>When a fall in prices signifies that a unit of money can buy more than    before. Money is then said to appreciate.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<div>In other words, the value of money and the general price level 
		are inversely proportion­s’ to each other. Violent changes in the value of money(or the price level) disturb economic life and do great harm. </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Measurement of Changes in the Value of Money:</h3>
    <h4>Index Numbers:</h4>
    <p>
    	<div>The device of index numbers helps in measuring changes in the value of money or price level. An index number is a statement in the form of a table which represents a change in the general price level. When it is desired to find out to what extent prices have risen or fallen, an index number is prepared.</div>
    	<div>In every advanced country, index numbers are being regularly prepared officially by the governments and also non-officially by other bodies interested in economic changes.</div>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="section3">
    <h3>Preparation of Index Numbers:</h3>
    <p>The following steps are necessary for the preparation of index numbers:</p>
  </section>
  <section id="section4">
    <h4>(a) Selection of the Base Year:</h4>
    <p>The first thing necessary is to select a base year. It is the year with which we 	wish to compare the present prices, in order to see how much the prices have risen or fallen. The base year must be a normal year. It should not be a year of famine, or war, or a year of exceptional prosperity.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="section5">
    <h4>(b) Selection of Commodities:</h4>
    <p>The next step is to select the commodities to be included in the index number. The commodities will depend on the purpose for which the index number is prepared . Suppose we want to know how a particular class of people has been affected by a change in the general price level. In that case, we should include only those commodities which enter into the consumption of that class.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="section6">
    <h4>(c) Collection of Prices:</h4>
    <p>After commodities have been selected, their prices have to be ascertained. Retail prices are the best for the purpose, because it is at the retail prices that a commodity is actually consumed. But retail prices differ almost from shop to shop, and there is no proper record of them. Hence we have to take the wholesale prices of which there are a proper record.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="section7">
    <h4>(d) Finding Percentage Change:</h4>
    <p>The next step is to represent the present prices as the percentages of the base year prices. The base year price is equated to 100, and then the current year’s price is represented accordingly. </p>
  </section>
  <section id="section8">
    <h4>(e) Averaging.</h4>
    <p>Finally, we take the average of both the base year and the current year figures in order to find out the overall change. i.e. In May 1985, the price index was 355 which means that the price on the average were more than three-and a-half times as much or 255 per cent higher than what they were in 1970-71</p>
    <h4>On Demand and Supply</h4>
    <p>The purchasing power of money is determined by the demand and supply of money , like the prices of all other economic goods and services. The particular relation between this demand and supply determines its particular purchasing power. </p>
  </section>
  <section id="section9">
    <h3>Limitations:</h3>
    <ol>
    	<li><h4>Approximations:</h4></li>
    	<li><h4>International Comparisons Difficult:</h4>
    		<p>i.e. on account of the different bases, different sets of commodities ordifferences in their quality, etc.</p></li>
    	<li><h4>Comparisons between Different Times Difficult:</h4><p>It is not easy to institute comparisons between different periods of time.Over long periods, some popular commodities are replaced by others.Entirely new commodities come to figure in consumption.</p></li>
    	<li><h4>Measure Sectional Price Levels Only:</h4><p>Index numbers measure only changes in the sectional price-levels. An index number, therefore, prepared for a particular purpose, may not beuseful for another. An entirely different set of commodities will have to be selected. Different people use different things and hold different assets. Therefore, different classes of people are affected differently by a given change in the price-level. Hence, the same index numbers cannot throw light on the effects of a price change on all sections of society.</p></li>
    	<li><h4> Weighting Changes Result:</h4></li>

    <h3>What are three factors that determine the value of money?</h3>
    <p>The three main factors that determine the value of money are exchange rates, the amount of dollars held in foreign reserves, and the value of Treasury notes.</p>

    <h3><a name="section11">Factors Affects the Value of Money?</a></h3>
    <ul>
    	<li><h4>Inflation</h4><p>Inflation reduces the value of money. When prices go up because wages arehigh and materials are scarce, it takes more money to buy goods. </p></li>
    	<li><h4>Devaluation</h4><p>Currency devaluation is an official action on the part of a national government to declare that its currency is worth less than it was previously. In addition, devaluing a currency makes exports more expensive to people who hold the devalued currency. This encourages spending on domestically made products and helps local industries.</p></li>
    	<li><h4>Exchange Rates</h4><p>Investors may choose to exchange their money for one currency rather than another based on assumptions and calculations as to whether that currency will retain its value. If investors all over the world want a particular currency, then it becomes worth more because it is in demand.</p></li>
    	<li><h4>Interest Rates</h4><p>Interest rates are established by government policies aimed at increasing or decreasing the flow of money by making it more or less valuable. High interest rates make a currency valuable because they offer a good rate of return and create a demand for that currency. </p></li>
    	<li><h4>Purchasing Power</h4><p>Money is worth more when it can buy more. If there is a steady supplyof available goods, then their price declines and the value of money risesrelative to what it can buy. Calculating the value of a currency over time often involves evaluating its purchasing power.
